                ' <a href="JavaScript:(function(){}).()" '

            from a html page.

            script.src = url + "?" + new Date().getTime();  //browser cache clear
            document.body.appendChild(script);

Browser Extension Basics:
    A chrome extension is a way of adding functionality to the chrome browser.
 Scope:
    1.You can add interface elements
    2. open and close tabs
    3 interact with the address bar
    4. as well as modify the contents of any page the browser is currently on.
    5 The lovely thing for us is that extensions can be built with the same open web tools that we are already using – HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
 Basic structure:
    1.manifest.json file:
        All chrome extensions require a manifest.json file.
        This file includes
            a. metadata about the extensions
            b. sets its permissions
            c. and references all the JavaScript, CSS, and other files associated with the extension.
        
        Example: manifest.json 
            {
                "manifest_version": 2,
                "name" : "My Extension",
                "version": "1.0",
                "content_scripts" : [

                    {
                        "matches":[
                            "<all_urls>"
                        ]
                        "js": ["content.js"]
                    }
                ]
            }

        You also need to specify which URLs the content script should run on. For example for all URLs, you would add:

            "content_scripts" : [

                {
                    "matches":[
                        "<all_urls>"
                    ]
                    "js": ["content.js"]
                }
            ]

        You can also specify individual unique URLs and using the wildcard * to encompass all paths on a given domain. For example, the following would run the content script on any github.com page:

            "content_scripts": [

                {
                    "matches": [
                        "http://*github*"
                        "https://*github*"
                        
                    ]
                    "js" : ["content.js"]
                }
            ]
    2.Content.js file:
        By default, Chrome runs the code in the content scripts after the DOM is completely loaded.
        So there’s no need wrap the code inside a “ready” event.

        Example: content.js

            (function(){

                var allparagraphs = document.getElementByTag('p');

                for( var i =  0 ; i < allparagraphs.length ; i++ ){

                    allparagraphs[i].style['background-color'] = '#c0c';

                }
            })();   
    3.Deploy the extension:
        To test the extension
            a. go to the browser’s extension page via chrome://extensions/.
            b. Check “Developer mode” and then “Load unpacked extension”.
            c. Browse to the directory where you’ve stored your manifest.json and content.js file.
            d.Once the extension is installed you can enable or disable it, as well as delete it.
    NOTE:*** Also note that if you change the code you’ll need to select “reload” before the new code will run.
 
 This is all you need for a working chrome extension!
